# iic master/slave
I claim that the best, most comprehensible, and easily modifiable I2C Bus Master and Slave blocks written in VHDL. They support all transfer types within the I2C standard and the I2C Clock Stretching feature. Situations where the transfer encounters a timeout can be easily added as needed.
